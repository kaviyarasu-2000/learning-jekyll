<p>Cyber. It is the inevitable prefix that currently defines our world. From people‚Äôs privacy to inter-state relations, the term ‚Äúcyber‚Äù dominates the headlines and discussions - so much so that we risk being paralyzed by the magnitude of the problems we face.</p>

<p>Despite the many remaining questions about the future of cybersecurity and governance, we must take into account that international cooperation is the key element in addressing the growing threats of cybercrime.</p>

<p>Online exploitation and abuse of girls and boys; the black cyber markets for the purchase and sale of illicit drugs and firearms; ransomware attacks and human traffickers making use of social networks to attract victims. The unprecedented scope of cybercrime - crossing borders in our homes, schools, businesses, hospitals and other vital service providers - only amplifies the threats.</p>
