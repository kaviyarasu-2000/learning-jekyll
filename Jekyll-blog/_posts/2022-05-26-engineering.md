Engineering

Engineering is surely a word most people have heard of before, but have you actually ever wondered what it means to be an engineer? Most people picture brainy individuals working behind the scenes on planes and trains, but there's so much more to this discipline than that. In the simplest terms, engineering is the act of using the scientific method to solve real-world problems, build practical machines and tools, and make the world a better place.

Engineers in this field are definitely the kind of people who like taking things apart, learning how they work, putting them back together, and troubleshooting any problems that may arise. As such, they enjoy designing and building machines that function for specific purposes.


Civil Engineering: 

Since the beginning of history, humans have engaged in civil engineering (it's believed to be the oldest type of engineering). Simply put, civil engineering is the act of developing and maintaining buildings, roads, bridges, and dams. You know your fancy toilet? Yeah-those are pretty new in the grand scheme of things. Well, they wouldn't exist without civil engineers who designed not only sewage systems, but water filtration systems. Without these individuals, the world would look closer to the world.
